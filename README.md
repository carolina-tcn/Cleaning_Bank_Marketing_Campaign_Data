# Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data

Data cleaning and preprocessing for bank marketing campaign analysis.

---

## Project Instructions

Subset, clean, and reformat the `bank_marketing.csv` dataset to create and store three new files based on the requirements detailed in the notebook.

Split and tidy `bank_marketing.csv`, storing as three DataFrames called **client**, **campaign**, and **economics**, each containing the columns outlined in the notebook and formatted to the specified data types.

Save the three DataFrames to CSV files, **without an index**, as `client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, and `economics.csv` respectively.

## Background

Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is around 10%. This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed around £1.5 billion, which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

You have been asked to work with a bank to clean the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward and would like you to ensure the data conforms to their specified structure and data types. This will allow them to set up a PostgreSQL database to store this campaign's data and facilitate easy import of future campaigns.

They have supplied a CSV file called `bank_marketing.csv` which you need to clean, reformat, and split into three final CSV files. Below are the details:
